ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* Android.mk
* CleanSpec.mk
* README
* tests/
* tests/Android.mk
* tests/AndroidManifest.xml
* tests/src/
* tests/src/com/
* tests/src/com/android/
* tests/src/com/android/calendarcommon2/
* tests/src/com/android/calendarcommon2/DurationTest.java
* tests/src/com/android/calendarcommon2/EventRecurrenceTest.java
* tests/src/com/android/calendarcommon2/RRuleTest.java
* tests/src/com/android/calendarcommon2/RecurrenceProcessorTest.java
* tests/src/com/android/calendarcommon2/RecurrenceSetTest.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => calendarCommon/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* src/ => calendarCommon/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
